             'Women don’t have a specific dress code for Ihram; they should wear clothing that covers their body properly without being extravagant, '
             'and they must avoid resembling men. They should remove face veils and gloves and wear a headscarf to cover their face and head from non-mahram men.\n\n',

  'mistake_2': '2- Believing that Ihram is just wearing the Ihram garments (the Rida and Izar), '
               'which is incorrect; the intention to enter the ritual is essential for the validity of Ihram.\n\n',
  'mistake_3': '3- Applying perfume to the Rida or Izar before Ihram; '
               'the Sunnah is to apply it to the body before Ihram, '
               'not to the Ihram garments.\n\n',
  'mistake_4': '4- Believing that washing or ablution at the time of Ihram is mandatory; '
               'it is rather a recommended Sunnah, and if one enters Ihram without it, their Ihram is valid.\n\n',
  'mistake_5': '5- Always uncovering the right shoulder from the time of Ihram at the Miqat, '
               'which is called "Idtiba," is against the Sunnah; '
               'the Prophet (peace be upon him) only did this during the Tawaf of arrival '
               'and Tawaf of Umrah. After completing the Tawaf, the pilgrim should cover both shoulders '

  'mistake_6': '6- Believing that a menstruating woman cannot enter Ihram, '
               'and that she may pass the Miqat without Ihram; '
               'she must enter Ihram before the Miqat, '
               'but she cannot perform Tawaf until she is purified.\n\n',
  'mistake_7': '7- Some women believe there are specific garments for Ihram; '

               'provided they avoid wearing the niqab and gloves.\n\n',
  'mistake_8': '8- Entering the ritual and then abandoning it before completion; '

  'tawaf_point_1': '1- It is recommended for the pilgrim to perform Tawaf Al-Qudum upon arriving in Mecca, and it does not replace Tawaf Al-Iffadah.\n\n',
  'tawaf_point_2': '2- When entering the Sacred Mosque, start with your right foot and say: "',
  'tawaf_bismillah': 'In the name of Allah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah. O Allah, forgive my sins and open the doors of Your mercy for me. I seek refuge with Allah, the Almighty, with His Noble Face, and His Eternal Sovereignty from the accursed devil.',
  'tawaf_point_2_end': '" and do not pray the two units of greeting for the mosque.\n\n',
  'tawaf_point_3': '3- Stop the Talbiyah, then circumambulate the Kaaba seven times. It is Sunnah for men to uncover their right shoulder during Tawaf of Umrah and Tawaf Al-Qudum only. The way is to expose your right shoulder by placing the middle of your garment under your right arm and its ends on your left shoulder, hastening in the first three rounds of Tawaf Al-Qudum only, starting with the Black Stone, ensuring the Kaaba is on your left. If you can reach the Black Stone, do so without harming others by pushing or shoving, as this is wrong. It is sufficient to point to the Black Stone from a distance, saying "Allahu Akbar" without stopping. You should not push others or harm them and continue through the seven rounds, avoiding harming people by pushing or raising your voice, and you may supplicate as you wish and recite the Qur\'an.\n\n',
  'tawaf_point_4': '4- When you are parallel to the Yemeni Corner, touch it with your right hand if you can, and do not kiss or wipe it as some people do, as this contradicts the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him). If you cannot touch the Yemeni Corner, continue your Tawaf without pointing to it or saying Takbir.\n\n',
  'tawaf_point_5': '5- It is Sunnah to say during Tawaf between the Yemeni Corner and the Black Stone: ',
  'tawaf_dua': '(Our Lord, grant us good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and save us from the torment of the Fire) from Surah Al-Baqarah.\n\n',
  'tawaf_point_6': '6- Each time you pass the Black Stone, say: Allahu Akbar.\n\n',
  'tawaf_point_7': '7- During Tawaf, it is recommended to frequently remember Allah and recite the Qur\'an, and to increase supplication. There is no specific supplication for each round in Tawaf, but every good supplication is encouraged, especially those mentioned in the Qur\'an and Sunnah.\n\n',
  'tawaf_point_8': '8- Do not supplicate for sin or severing ties of kinship.\n\n',
  'tawaf_point_9': '9- Do not raise your voice in remembrance and supplication during Tawaf, as this contradicts the Sunnah and disturbs the worshippers.\n\n',
   'tawaf_mistakes_title': 'Common Mistakes in Tawaf',
  'mistake_11': '1- Pronouncing the intention when starting the Tawaf; the correct place for intention is in the heart, so it should not be verbalized.\n\n',
  'mistake_22': '2- Believing that Tawaf is invalid without touching the Black Stone; the correct practice is that kissing the stone is Sunnah. If the pilgrim cannot reach it without harming others, it is obligatory to refrain from touching and simply point to it.\n\n',
  'mistake_33': '3- Some perform Tawaf from inside the Hijr, believing their Tawaf is valid; in reality, the Hijr is part of the Kaaba, so one must circumambulate outside it.\n\n',
  'mistake_44': '4- Touching all corners and walls of the Kaaba is not permissible; these are practices not followed by the Prophet (peace be upon him).\n\n',
  'mistake_55': '5- Raml (quick walking) should only be done in the first three rounds of Tawaf Al-Qudum and Tawaf of Umrah, not all rounds.\n\n',
  'mistake_66': '6- Men and women should avoid pushing against each other during Tawaf.\n\n',
  'mistake_77': '7- Assigning specific supplications for each round; the only mentioned supplication is: ',
  'tawaf_duaa': 'Our Lord, grant us good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and save us from the torment of the Fire (Al-Baqarah: 201).\n\n',
  'mistake_88': '8- Raising one’s voice excessively in supplication disrupts the worshippers.\n\n',
  'mistake_99': '9- Leaving Tawaf just steps away from the Black Stone; ensure the Tawaf is completed, as leaving a part invalidates it.\n\n',

Whoever drinks it with the intention of healing will be healed by the permission of Allah, and whoever drinks it with the intention of success in good deeds will be granted success by the permission of Allah. There is no known hadith from the Prophet (peace be upon him) indicating the recommendation to make supplication when drinking Zamzam; however, Al-Daraqutni narrated from Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he would say when drinking Zamzam: "O Allah, I ask You for beneficial knowledge, abundant provision, and healing from every disease."',

Ibn Majah narrated with a weak chain from Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: "When you drink from it (Zamzam), face the Qiblah, mention the name of Allah, breathe three times, and drink deeply from it. When you finish, praise Allah, for the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: "The sign between us and the hypocrites is that they do not drink deeply from Zamzam."',

  'mina_day_8_night': 'It is Sunnah to spend the night in Mina on the evening of the Day of Tarwiyah, the night of the 9th of Dhul-Hijjah, and pray Fajr there. When you have prayed Fajr, wait until the sun rises, then proceed to Arafat.',

It is recommended for the pilgrim to perform Tawaf and pray frequently in the Masjid al-Haram due to its great virtue, if it is easy for him to do so. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not return to the Masjid al-Haram after Tawaf al-Qudum, but remained in al-Muhassab, perhaps to leave space for those who had not yet performed Tawaf and Sa’i, and Allah knows best.',

On this day, the throngs of pilgrims gather on the plains of Arafat, where Muslims stand on this great day in Arafat from the time the sun passes its zenith (Dhuhr time) until sunset. On this day, Allah boasts of them to His angels. In Sahih Muslim, it is narrated from Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: "There is no day on which Allah frees more people from the Fire than on the Day of Arafah. He draws near and boasts to the angels, saying: What do these people want?" We ask Allah for His bounty and favor.',

  'arafah_mistake_2': 'Departing from Arafah before sunset. This is not permissible because it contradicts the actions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Whoever does this must offer a sacrifice (blood).',
  'arafah_mistake_3': 'Crowding and pushing in order to climb Mount Arafah, reach its summit, touch it, and pray in it. This is an innovation that has no basis in Islamic law, in addition to the health and physical harm that results from it.',

  'muzdalifah_mistake_2': 'Delaying the Maghrib and Isha prayers until after midnight. The Sunnah for the pilgrim is to pray them together in Muzdalifah before the end of the time for Isha, which is midnight. If that is not possible, then he should pray them in any place before the end of the time.',
  'muzdalifah_mistake_3': 'Praying Fajr in Muzdalifah before its time, in order to hasten departure. This is contrary to the Sunnah. Moreover, prayer before its time is invalid and not acceptable.',
  'muzdalifah_mistake_4': 'Departing to collect pebbles before praying Maghrib and Isha together, shortened.',
  'muzdalifah_mistake_5': 'Some people believe that it is obligatory to collect pebbles from Muzdalifah. The correct view is that it is permissible to collect them from any place that is convenient.',
  'muzdalifah_mistake_6': 'Remaining in Muzdalifah until the sun of Yawm al-Nahr (the Day of Sacrifice) rises. The Sunnah is to depart from it before the sunrise of that day, in opposition to the polytheists who used to wait until the sun rose.',
  'muzdalifah_mistake_7': 'Spending the night in worship. This is contrary to what is established from the actions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), for he slept on that night.',
  'muzdalifah_mistake_8': 'Spending that night in chatting and joking, eating and drinking, and wasting time in what does not benefit the pilgrim in his Hereafter.',
   'stoning_intro': 'Stoning the Jamarat is one of the obligatory acts of Hajj, and neglecting it requires offering a sacrifice (blood). The stoning on the day of Eid is only for Jamrat al-Aqaba al-Kubra with seven pebbles.

  'stoning_mistake_3': 'Stoning the three Jamarat (small, middle, and large) on the day of Eid.',
  'stoning_mistake_4': 'Some people think that these Jamarat are devils, and that they are stoning devils. So you find one of them coming with great violence, anger, and rage, reacting with great emotion, as if the devil is in front of him.',
  'stoning_mistake_5': 'Some people are negligent and do not care whether the pebble falls into the target or not.',
  'stoning_mistake_6': 'Some people think that the pebble must hit the pillar in the target. This is a mistaken belief. What is required is to aim the throw in the correct place inside the basin, whether it hits the pillar or not.',

  'hair_cut_mistake_5': 'Some believe that a muhrim cannot shave or shorten the hair of another muhrim who wants to release ihram, which is a mistaken belief.',

After the pilgrim throws the stones at Jamrat al-Aqaba on the morning of Eid, he descends to Mecca to perform seven circuits of Tawaf al-Ifadah, and if he is a mutamatti, he must also perform seven laps of Sa’i afterward. This applies unless he has already performed Sa’i with Tawaf al-Qudum if he is a qarin or mufrid.\n\n'

  'mistake_333': '3. Some pilgrims performing Sa’i between Safa and Marwah after the Farewell Tawaf, believing that it is required; the correct view is that Sa’i is not prescribed after the Farewell Tawaf unless performed with Tawaf al-Ifadah.',
  'mistake_444': '4. Walking backward after the Farewell Tawaf; if the pilgrim wants to exit the Sacred Mosque, he should walk backward toward the Kaaba without looking back, which is not Sunnah but an innovation.',
  'mistake_555': '5. Some circumambulators standing after the Farewell Tawaf at the mosque entrance, facing the Kaaba, saying a specific farewell supplication, which has not been established from the Prophet (peace be upon him).',
 'hajj_text': '''The Sunnah is for the pilgrim to go to the place of slaughter in Mina — after completing the stoning of the largest Jamrah — to slaughter or sacrifice his offering there. If he is unable, it is permissible for him to do so anywhere in Mina or in Mecca if he is a mutamatti or qarin who has brought his offering with him; this is supported by the verse: "And the sacrificial animals We have made for you among the symbols of Allah; in them is good for you" (Hajj: 36), and the verse: "And whoever honors the symbols of Allah, indeed, it is from the piety of hearts" (Hajj: 32). Ibn Abd al-Barr said: "They all agreed that the verse 'Then its place of sacrifice is at the Ancient House' (Hajj: 33) does not mean to sacrifice in the Ancient House, as the House is not a place for blood, for Allah has commanded its purification; rather, by mentioning the Ancient House, He meant Mecca and Mina." This is supported by the Prophet’s saying: "I sacrificed here, and all of Mina is a place of sacrifice; so sacrifice in your camps," and his saying: "And every path in Mecca is a road and a place of sacrifice." 

It is obligatory for someone who has a sacrifice due to performing Hajj as a qarin or mutamatti to sacrifice on the days of sacrifice, which are the days when the Prophet and his companions sacrificed, which are the day of Eid and the three days of Tashreeq, a total of four days. These are the days of sacrifice. The Prophet (peace be upon him) came with his camels for sacrifice but did not sacrifice until the day of Eid, and likewise his companions. Whoever sacrifices before Eid must repeat that; he should buy a sacrifice in Mecca and sacrifice it there after Hajj when it is feasible for him, and he should distribute it among the poor of Mecca in the Sacred Area instead of the sacrifice he slaughtered before its time. If he is unable and does not have the means, he should fast for ten days instead of that sacrifice. This is what is prescribed. It is permissible for the pilgrim to appoint someone to slaughter the sacrifice on his behalf.''',

Its description is that you uncover your right shoulder, placing the middle of your garment under your right armpit and its ends on your left shoulder, hastening in the first three rounds of Tawaf of arrival only. Begin at the Black Stone; if you can reach it, kiss it, provided you do not harm others by pushing or arguing. It suffices to point to the Black Stone from a distance while saying "Allahu Akbar," without stopping. You should not push others or harm them; continue through the seven circuits, avoiding harming others by pushing or raising your voice, and pray as you wish and recite the Qur'an.''',
  'umrah_tawaf_step_3': '''3- If you align with the Yemeni corner, touch it with your hand if you can; do not kiss it or rub against it as some people do, which contradicts the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him). If you cannot touch the Yemeni corner, continue your Tawaf without pointing to it or saying Takbeer.''',
  'umrah_tawaf_step_4': '''4- It is Sunnah to say during Tawaf between the Yemeni corner and the Black Stone: (Our Lord, give us in this world good and in the Hereafter good, and protect us from the punishment of the Fire.) Surah Al-Baqarah.''',

  'umrah_tawaf_step_6': '''6- During Tawaf, it is recommended to increase your remembrance of Allah, recite the Qur'an, and make abundant supplication.

  'umrah_tawaf_step_7': '''7- Do not raise your voice in remembrance and supplication during Tawaf.''',
  'hair_cut_step_1': '1- You should shave your hair or shorten it, and it is preferable in Umrah to shorten it so that you have enough to shave in Hajj. Unless there is a long interval, then you can shave all your head. The Prophet (peace be upon him) made supplication for those who shave three times and once for those who shorten.',
  'hair_cut_step_2': '2- If you choose to shorten your hair, it should cover all parts of your head; it is not sufficient to shorten one side and leave the other.',
  'hair_cut_step_3': '3- Women do not shave their heads but shorten their hair by cutting a fingertip’s length from each braid.',
  'hair_cut_step_4': '4- It is permissible to shave for yourself or another person even before you become free from Ihram.',
  'hair_cut_step_5': '5- The pilgrim is allowed everything after becoming free from Ihram, including women, and remains in Mecca in a state of permissibility until the Day of Tarwiyah.',

Begin the Tawaf of Umrah, which consists of seven circuits with the Kaaba on your left side throughout. Each circuit starts in front of the Black Stone and ends there. Then stand in front of the Black Stone; if you can kiss it, that is a great virtue without crowding or harming anyone. When you reach it, say: 'In the name of Allah, Allah is the Greatest,' or just say: 'Allah is the Greatest.' If you cannot kiss it, touch it with your hand and kiss your hand. If you cannot reach it, point to it with your right hand without kissing it and say: 'Allah is the Greatest.' During the first three circuits, you should walk briskly, quickly placing your steps. When you reach the Yemeni corner, touch it with your right hand and say: 'In the name of Allah, Allah is the Greatest,' but do not kiss it.
